## Recipe Management API with FastAPI

This document outlines the design and features of a FastAPI backend for managing recipes, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.

**Models:**

The API utilizes three models:

1. **Recipe:** This model represents a recipe with attributes like title, description, cooking instructions, and a list of `Ingredient` objects.
2. **Ingredient:** This model represents an ingredient used in a recipe, including its name and quantity.
3. **NutritionalInfo:** This model represents the nutritional information for a recipe with custom data types for calories, fat, protein, carbs, etc. Nested models are used to link ingredients to recipes, allowing for representing ingredient quantities within a recipe.

**Endpoints:**

The API provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for recipes, ingredients, and nutritional information through various endpoints:

- **Create:** Allows creating new recipes with details and ingredients.
- **Read:** Enables retrieving recipes based on specific criteria (e.g., by ID, title, etc.).
- **Update:** Provides functionality to modify existing recipes and their information.
- **Delete:** Allows deleting recipes and associated data.

These endpoints utilize request body parameters to accept recipe data and ensure proper validation for all fields:

- String validation for recipe title and description ensures correct text input.
- Numeric validation for ingredient quantities and nutritional information guarantees accurate data representation.

**Search and Filtering:**

The API offers endpoints for searching and filtering recipes based on various criteria:

- **Search by title:** Helps users find recipes by keyword.
- **Filter by ingredients:** Allows users to search for recipes containing specific ingredients.
- **Nutritional filtering:** Enables filtering based on dietary preferences like low-calorie, vegetarian, or gluten-free options (implementation details depend on the chosen approach).

These functionalities use query parameters to provide flexibility in searching and filtering recipes.

**Advanced Features (Optional):**

- **Nutritional Calculation:** The API can potentially calculate and store nutritional information for each recipe based on the nutritional values of its ingredients. This requires additional logic or integration with third-party APIs.
- **Third-party Integration:** The API could integrate with external APIs or libraries to fetch additional details about ingredients, such as retrieving nutritional data from food databases.

**Documentation and Testing:**

The API will be documented using FastAPI's built-in capabilities or tools like Swagger UI to provide clear and comprehensive documentation for developers and users.

- **API Documentation:** Users can easily understand the available endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and expected behaviors.
- **Testing:** Rigorous test cases will be implemented to ensure the functionality of each endpoint, covering various scenarios including edge cases and error handling. This ensures a robust and reliable API.

**Additional Documentation:**

- A separate readme file can be created to detail the specific functionalities of each endpoint.
- If third-party APIs are used, documentation on their integration and usage can be included.

This design delivers a comprehensive and well-structured recipe management API using FastAPI. By implementing robust features, validation, and documentation, the API ensures a user-friendly and reliable platform for managing and exploring recipes.
